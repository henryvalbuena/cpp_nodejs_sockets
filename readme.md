## Technologies
Server: JavaScript, Node.js
Client: C/C++
TCP Socket data streams

## What does it do?

The general idea is to have a desktop app that communicates with a remote server and request specific data either from a database or the internet.

## Why I did this?

To explore the whole process of data communications and software development combined together.

## Is this helpful in someway?

If you're not interested in creating a C/C++ application without any 3rd party library as well as a nodejs server using only built in methods just for your own enjoyment and excitement of learning, then is not.

## How it works?

Underdevelopment...
